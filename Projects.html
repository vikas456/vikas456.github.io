            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Java based PC game in which the user stacks blocks on top of one another to create the tallest tower.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>This project was originally a class project during which we had to create a Java based computer game. In this game, a block will be moving horizontally on the top of the screen, and a platform will be stationary on the bottom. The object is to click the mouse to drop the blocks onto the platform. Any excess block that is over the ends of the platform gets cut off and the placed block becomes the platform making the platform equal to or smaller than the previous one. The user is allotted points based on the amount of blocks placed. The game ends when the user misses the platform.</p>
            <p>After the project was over, we added a power up component in which blocks with special attributes will randomly appear in order to add a more competitive aspect to the game.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Android ride share application intended to be used amongst a closed group.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>When volunteering, not everyone has a car to get to the volunteering location, so they need rides from their friends or other volunteers. This becomes a confusing process and someone always gets left out. This app solves that problem by allowing users to create a group, enter their car information if they have one, and their preference for a driver. It then assigns users to different cars on a first come first serve basis. A day before the actual event the group closes and the ride assignments are emailed to all members of the group.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Android application that teaches users the legal consequences of the most common illegal actions in the United States.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>I took a government class over the summer and learned about the different State and Federal laws as well as the consequences regarding breaking those laws. In doing so, I came to the realization that many, including myself, donâ€™t know the repercussions of even the simplest of crimes. For this reason, I made an app to educate everyone about the repercussions of illegal activities. Hopefully this knowledge will persuade people to avoid such activities. This is my first application launched on the Google Play Store.</p>
            <p>Version 2 of this app will be released shortly with updates including more states and information for juvenile crimes. Also, I hope to learn web scraping by the release of the second version so that the app will be automatically updated whenever the federal database is.</p>

            <p>Website that details me including my activities, achievements, and contact information.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>When constructing my resume, I felt like I couldn't include all the details. So as a solution, I built a personal website that provides details as a supplement to my resume that recruiters can go through if they want to learn more about me.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Java program that imitates the Huffman Coding algorithm and compresses both text and image files.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>This project was originally given to me in my data structures class and was my favorite program out of all the programs because of the difficulty and thought required in order to finish it. We had to tally the number of occurrences of each letter in the file then arranged them into a tree based on the that number. After creating the tree, we made a new binary representation of the ASCII code of each letter by going down the constructed tree. Then we wrote the new binary representations into an encrypted file.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Android scheduling application that takes into account multiple user availabilities to calculate the ideal meeting time.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>Whenever my friends and I want to plan an event, we always have difficulty planning a date that the most people are free during.</p>
            <p>This app, allows the user to create an event and enter all the times they are available for that event. The app then calculates which dates and times the most users are available for and presents them as options to the creator of the event who then chooses the final meeting date and time.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Java course project in which the user is to play the game of hangman. However, there is a catch. The computer will not pick the word that the game is centered around until it absolutely has to. Afterwards, the computer will still change the word with the given letter constraints to make it almost impossible for the user to guess the correct word and win the game.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>This project was also given to me in my Data Structures class and primarily utilizes my favorite data structure - maps - in order to accomplish the task. This was also one of the most difficult projects I've had because my original approach to the problem was too inefficient. However, because of the abundance of time I spent on this project (I had to start over due to program inefficiencies), this became one of my favorite projects in the class and really taught me to be patient and level-headed while coding.</p>
